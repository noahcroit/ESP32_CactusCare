/******************* Basic ControlBox Phase *******************/
Solenoid Controller
1. Create 24V Solenoid Driver, consist of
	- 12V-to-24V Converter with MC34064 @ 1A
	- Coil ON/OFF Driver with simple N-MOSFET
	- EN pin for activate converter, IN pin for on/off solenoid

2. Create ESP32 Driver for solenoid driver
	- Driver
	- Test software to control solenoid with simple button
	


Soil Moisture Sensor
1. Create interface board, Wiring
2. Create ESP32 Driver for soil moister sensor
	- Driver
	- How to calibrate sensor
	- Test software



Create ESP32 main board
- Solenoid control section
- Soil sensor and others sensor interface
- ESP32 section + 12V-to-5V PSU
	
	

Combine & Create ControlBox (Manual Control)

/******************** IoT ControlBox Phase *********************/
Use WIFI on ESP32
- Setup WIFI on ESP32 to connect to any router


HTTP/MQTT Client on ESP32
1. Software for HTTP client/or server on ESP32 to monitor tag
2. Software for MQTT client on ESP32 to monitor tag with MQTT server (RaspberryPi)

3. Select which one should we use MQTT or HTTP?
